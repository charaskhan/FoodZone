The Food Ordering Management System project is designed to streamline the online food ordering process, addressing common issues faced by customers in traditional restaurant settings. 

## Summary of the System
This system leverages the growing demand for online food ordering, providing an accessible interface for customers to view menus, place orders, and manage their selections efficiently. Customers can register with minimal details, browse menu items, add them to their cart, and submit orders. All data is stored in a MySQL database for easy retrieval. Additionally, employees or administrators manage product listings and order deliveries.

## Problem Statement
Traditional restaurant ordering methods often lead to customer dissatisfaction due to:
- Limited time to review menu items.
- Long queues and waiting times.
- Inconvenience for customers unable to visit physically.

The online food ordering system aims to eliminate these hurdles by allowing customers to view detailed descriptions of menu items and place orders from anywhere.

## Users of the System
The system serves two primary user groups:
1. **Customers**: They can browse the menu, place orders, and track their deliveries.
2. **Employees**: Responsible for updating menu items and managing deliveries.

## Database Users
Top-level management will utilize the database to analyze business performance, including:
- Most popular items.
- Items that are rarely ordered.
- Daily sales figures.
- Delivery metrics.

This comprehensive approach enhances customer experience while optimizing restaurant operations.
