Werfellie Emna> Food Ordering Management System PHP &amp; MySQL Project### Summary of the System: There is a significant opportunity in the online food ordering business that can be maximized as everyone has internet access for ordering food. The food industry typically experiences high demand, making online food ordering a profitable venture. We aim to provide a user-friendly interface where customers can easily view and place their orders.The customer can register with minimal details initially and can browse the menu items before adding them to the cart and placing the order. All details are stored in a MySQL database for easy retrieval. The system also caters to employees/administrators who manage product information and oversee the delivery process.### Problem Statement:The traditional way of conducting food business in restaurants has remained unchanged for many years. Customers often face the challenge of deciding quickly based on limited menu information and then waiting in queues for their orders. This waiting time can sometimes be so long that customers lose interest in their chosen item. Additionally, some customers may not have the time to physically visit the restaurant to eat. To address these issues, an online food ordering system has been designed to provide detailed item descriptions and streamline the ordering process, eliminating common obstacles faced when ordering food in person.### Users of the System:The system caters to both customers and employees. Employees are responsible for updating menu items and ensuring timely delivery to specified addresses. Customers visit the website, browse the menu, and place orders. All activities, including online ordering, delivery by employees, and the vehicles used for delivery, are recorded in the database.### Users of the Database:Top-level management in the food business utilizes the database to gather insights such as:1. Most demanded item2. Items that have not been ordered3. Daily business turnover4. Details on how deliveries are being executed### pre_index template:![preIndex][]### index template:![home_page_desgin][]### Project Source:[Food Ordering Management System PHP & MySQL Project](https://1000projects.org/food-ordering-management-system-php-mysql-project.html)
